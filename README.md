# 🔥 **Fire Propagation Simulation in Forests**

📅 **Duration**: Mar 2023 – May 2023  
**Technologies**: Python, Graph Theory, Probability, Physics  

---

## 📝 **Project Overview**
This project simulates forest fire propagation using a **Graph Theory** approach and the **Rothermel model** to compute fire spread probabilities. By implementing a **Monte Carlo Algorithm**, the simulation mimics fire behavior in various conditions, providing a dynamic and realistic representation. A simple **GUI** is built using **NetworkX** for real-time visualization of the fire spread across forest landscapes.

## ⚙️ **Features**
- 🌳 **Graph Theory-based approach** to represent the forest as interconnected nodes.
- 🌬️ Utilized the **Rothermel model** to compute fire spread probabilities based on environmental factors.
- 🎲 **Monte Carlo Algorithm** implemented to simulate fire propagation and randomness in the model.
- 🖥️ **Interactive GUI** built with **NetworkX** for real-time visualization of the fire spreading.

## 📊 **Simulation Breakdown**
- **Fire Spread Probability**: Computed using the Rothermel model, factoring in environmental conditions like wind, moisture, and terrain.
- **Graph Theory**: The forest is represented as a graph, where each node is a section of the forest, and edges represent the potential for fire spread.
- **Monte Carlo Algorithm**: Adds randomness to simulate various possible fire spread scenarios.

---

## 🔧 **Technologies Used**
- **Python**: Main programming language.
- **NetworkX**: For creating and visualizing the forest graph.
- **Matplotlib**: Used for plotting and visual representation.
- **Monte Carlo Simulation**: For probabilistic fire spread.

---

## 🌟 **Future Enhancements**
- 🔄 Incorporate more environmental factors like humidity and soil type.
- 📊 Add more detailed analysis of fire spread patterns.
- 📈 Improve the visualization with more complex graphical outputs.
